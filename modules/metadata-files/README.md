# Metadata Files

!! Deprecated !!

This module has been replaced by the platform-independent
`resinstack/local/metadata`.  It will be removed in version v0.4.0.

This module provides base metadata for consumption by the metadata
provider in the ResinStack.  You will typically use this module in
tandem with a machine-pool module to specify the base metadata for
that pool.
